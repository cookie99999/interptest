# interptest
This code follows Robert Nystrom's book Crafting Interpreters, though in Rust rather than Java. Eventually I'd like to use this knowledge to put together a small higher level language for my 65816 homebrew computer.

## Current state:
As of this readme edit, I've nearly completed chapter 6. Error handling needs to be reworked, and some borrowing-related errors resolved. At the end of this chapter, the code will print an AST in an RPN-like format, for the subset of the grammar currently implemented.
