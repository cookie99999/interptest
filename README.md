# interptest
This code follows Robert Nystrom's book Crafting Interpreters, though in Rust rather than Java. Eventually I'd like to use this knowledge to put together a small higher level language for my 65816 homebrew computer.

## Current state:
As of this readme edit, I've completed chapter 8. Variable declaration/assignment, expressions, print statements, and block scoping are working. Next will be functions.
